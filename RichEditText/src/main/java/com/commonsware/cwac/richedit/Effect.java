 * Base class for all effects. An "effect" is a particular

 * RichEditText. Mostly, these will be wrappers around

 * The generic type T is the sort of configuration information
 * that the effect needs -- many will be Effect<Boolean>,
 * meaning the effect is a toggle (on or off), such as boldface.
